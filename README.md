# HIV/SHIV-Therapeutic Interfering Particles ( TIPs )

This repository contains code and data associated with modeling of viral dynamics (Simian/Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Human Immunodeficiency Virus), submitted as "_Engineered HIV deletion variants replicate 
conditionally in non-human primates to reduce viral load and disease_" 
@ Weinberger Lab in Gladstone Institutes and UC San Francisco, San Francisco




## Code
1. "HIV-Bioreactor" : 
    Mathematical models for bioreactor design requirements for emergence and amplifcation of DIPs _in-vitro_ in 

2. "SIV-TIP-MCMC":
    Model parameterization by fitting virus-dynamics models to _in-vivo_ viral kinetics from _rhesus macaques_ using Bayesian inference with Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Also, scripts and data files for figures are included.


3. "HIV-TIP":
	Simulation files for testing the therapeutic efficacy of HIV-TIPs in human individuals based on model-parameterization of SIV-TIP
