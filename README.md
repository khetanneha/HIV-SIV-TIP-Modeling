# HIV/SHIV-Therapeutic Interfering Particles ( TIPs )

This repository contains the code and data associated with 
work published as "Engineered HIV deletion variants replicate 
conditionally in non-human primates to reduce viral load and disease" 
@ Weinberger Lab in Gladstone Institutes and UC San Francisco, San Francisco




## Code
This repository includes codes, and data files associated with:
1. Mathematical models for bioreactor design for emergence and amplifcation of DIPs _in-vitro_ in [ HIV-Bioreactor ]
2. Mathematical modeling of TIPs in vivo (rhesus macaque data)
3. Prediction of TIP efficacy in HIV-infected individuals
  

## Raw Data 
* Scripts and files : plots in manuscript
*  _In-vivo_ _Rhesus__macaques_data : PVL, TIP-DNA, CD4+ and Integrated-TIP
