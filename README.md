[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.10970897.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10970897)

This repository contains code and data associated with modeling of viral dynamics (Simian/Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Human Immunodeficiency Virus) in submission
@ Weinberger Lab at Gladstone Institutes and UC San Francisco, San Francisco




## Code
1. "HIV-Bioreactor" : 
    Mathematical models for bioreactor design requirements for emergence and amplifcation of DIPs _in-vitro_ in 

2. "SIV-TIP-MCMC":
    Model parameterization by fitting virus-dynamics models to _in-vivo_ viral kinetics from _rhesus macaques_ using Bayesian inference with Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Also, scripts and data files for figures are included.


3. "HIV-TIP":
	Simulation files for testing the therapeutic efficacy of HIV-TIPs in human individuals based on model-parameterization of SIV-TIP
